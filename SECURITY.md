## Reporting a Vulnerability

**For Internal Members**
If any security issues are uncovered that are not easily fixed OR can/has caused a serious security risk, contact one of the project leaders directly, as soon as possible.

**For External Community Members**
If you uncover anything that you think may be a security risk, please contact one of our project leaders directly to alert us of the issue. 
*DO NOT SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST* even if that request fixes the issue. You can provide your fix to the project leader and it will be reviewed and implemented from there.

### All Security Alerts for a given Version will be posted publicly in that versions project board. 
Please check the board regularly to be sure that you are not using and outdated source. **We WILL** fix all issues as they arise 
as quickly as possible. Security Patches do not impact the Version History for now, and we will provide a clear
update to alert everyone long before that changes.
